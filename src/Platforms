*Send mail to beek@imaginary.com if you experience any problems 
compiling or running on these systems.  Note that some of these machines have 
old versions of yacc and do require bison (a yacc replacement) to compile 
MudOS correctly.  If you manage to compile and run MudOS on a system other 
than one listed here, please send the diffs along with machine and OS 
information to the mudos-bugs address.

MSDOS versions of MudOS are available in the /pub/mud/drivers/mudos/msdos
directory on ftp.ccs.neu.edu.
