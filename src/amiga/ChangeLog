        * brought SMakefile up to date with release, added make_packages
	  script, and renamed strip.c to cstrip.c
	* removed simulated socket code for now; to merge in latest
	  support code from adr32's hosts/amiga/ dir would require
	  significant changes to the driver source
	* cleaned up header files a bit

Mon Jun 27 19:25:40 PDT 1994 (apang@mindlink.bc.ca (Robocoder))
	* SMakefile: fixed some dependency problems

Sat Jun 25 18:23:56 1994    Anthon Pang         (robocoder@delta.city)
    o   binaries.c: added LATTICE check for check_times() to adjust
          pathnames starting with '/' when calling stat(); now loads
          up to date binaries correctly
    o   binaries.c, simulate.c: added LATTICE checks to
          fflush(stderr) if comp_flag, otherwise stdio package waits
          until newline to flush buffer output
    o   comm.c: added LATTICE check to add_message() to fflush(stderr)
          when it writes to stderr

Sat Jun 18 04:32:14 1994    Anthon Pang         (robocoder@delta.city)
    o   port.c: added LATTICE support for get_cpu_times() and get_usec_clock()
    o   efuns_port.c: added LATTICE support for f_rusage()
    o   func_spec.c: added LATTICE support for rusage() efun
    o   lex.c: added LATTICE support for HAS_RUSAGE

Thu Jun  9 20:31:37 1994    Anthon Pang         (robocoder@delta.city)
    o   file.c: #if LATTICE'd appending '/' on current dir, if path is root
          dir, since this messes up stat() (used in get_dir(path, -1))

Tue Jun  7 21:04:45 1994    Anthon Pang         (robocoder@tmi-2)
    o   amiga/amiga.h: FD_SETSIZE conflicted with AmiTCP includes, moved to
          socket_tcp.h and socket_sim.h

Tue Jun  7 05:38:55 1994    Anthon Pang         (robocoder@tmi-2)
    o   object.c: was doing it's own call to rename()...put in a LATTICE
          check to unlink the target if it already exists
    o   rc.c: added LATTICE check for ':' in CONFIG_FILE_DIR, to not
          append trailing '/' before tacking on file name
    o   object.c, file.c: many places where it would call fopen() and then
          fstat()... but on Amiga, this operation could fail (since file was
          open for writing)... changed them all to call stat() before fopen()

Mon Jun  6 01:09:40 1994    Anthon Pang         (robocoder@tmi-2)
    o   amiga/ChangeLog: added
    o   *.*: Raked over the LATTICE #includes; various casts added; various
          unreferenced variables removed (carefully ignoring those that the
          compiler eliminated by optimization)
    o   amiga/socket.h: includes socket_amitcp.h if AMITCP defined; moved
          the true socket #includes here, if either AMITCP or AMIGA_TCP
          is defined
    o   amiga/socket.c: includes socket_amitcp.c if AMITCP defined
    o   amiga/socket_amitcp.{h|c}: added for AmiTCP support
    o   amiga/socket_[ami]tcp.c: declared amiga_sockinit() and amiga_sockexit()
          to both return void; note: neither is used if driver compiled &
          linked under SAS/C (ie relying on autoinit code built into netlib)
    o   amiga/SMakefile: (was amiga/Makefile) now up to date with ./Makefile
    o   amiga/ccdep.h: compiler dependent stuff from amiga.h; currently
          only for SAS/C -> DICE support
    o   amiga/varargs.h: non-ANSI support, taken from amiga.h
    o   amiga/times.h: extracted from amiga.h; Unix timeval support;
          separated to reduce conflict with netinclude:sys/time.h
    o   amiga/nsignal.h: some signal stuff from amiga.h moved here
