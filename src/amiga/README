AMIGA/README

***NOTE***  The following instructions are for using SAS/C.  If you wish to
compile with gcc instead (which is in fact easier) read the file README-gcc
instead.

Compiling the driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this time, you require:

	SAS/C
	a networking package -- either AmiTCP or AS225

To build the driver, select the appropriate networking package in the
SMakefile, in addition to configuring any other options, and run "smake".

Note: if using AmiTCP, the logical directories NETINCLUDE: and NETLIB:
      should be assigned.


Installing and running a mud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(I assume you've already downloaded the driver...)

Install a networking package (runtime system) -- AmiTCP or AS225

Download a mudlib; if an "options.h" file is supplied, copy this to the
main drive source directory; most likely, you'll want to change the
#define for CONFIG_FILE_DIR

Install the driver; a sample config file is given in "Config.example"

Edit your config file (eg "config.file") according to where the lib is
located, port number, etc

Run the driver ("driver config.file")

Telnet (or letnet) to the mud, eg "telnet localhost 4444",
where 4444 is the assigned port specified in your config file


Source notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Amiga support code is courtesy of Martin Brenner, Lars Duening, John
Fehr, and Anthon Pang, and heavily based on the hosts/amiga code included
with adr32.  The only major differences are the lack of DICE compiler
support and the simulated sockets code.  The omission of the later may
bother some people...so I (A. Pang) will explain why:  "I don't like
kludgy code".  Moreover, significant changes in the main driver source
would be required.
